For the most up-to-date catalogue, see list near the top of `execution.py`. The list here also includes the "special variables," which have different behavior when accessed and/or assigned. Eventually, every letter h-z should appear below.

`_` Identity function (== `{a}`)

`h` 100

`i` 0

`k` `", "`

`l` Empty list

`m` 1000 (mnemonic: Roman numeral M)

`n` Newline character

`o` 1

`q` Special variable: reads and returns a line of input each time it is accessed

`r` Special variable: returns a random number 0 <= `r` < 1 when it is accessed; assigning to `r` seeds the random-number generator

`s` Space character

`t` 10

`u` Nil

`v` -1

`w` Pattern matching 1 or more whitespace characters (<code>`\s+`</code>)

`x` Empty string

`y` Empty string (modified by `Y` operator)

`z` Lowercase alphabet

`B` Block that returns its second argument (`{b}`)

`AZ` Uppercase alphabet

`PA` All **P**rintable **A**SCII characters, 32 through 126

`PI` Pi
